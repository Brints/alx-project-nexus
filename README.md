# The Agora: A Modern Hub for Real-Time Consensus
In ancient Greece, the Agora was the central public square—a vibrant, open hub for assembly, civic discourse, democratic voting, and commerce. This project, The Agora, reimagines that concept as a robust, scalable, and real-time online polling system.

It serves as a backend-focused implementation for the ProDev BE case study, meticulously engineered to handle high-frequency operations, real-time data processing, and a scalable API-first architecture.
